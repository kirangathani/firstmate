Mode: Codex foreground checkpoint.

When this session owns supervision and away mode is not active:
1. Drain first with `bin/fm-wake-drain.sh`.
2. Source `__FM_X_MODE_ENV__` first when X mode is active.
3. First cycle: run one foreground watcher checkpoint with `bin/fm-watch-checkpoint.sh --seconds "${FM_CODEX_WATCH_CHECKPOINT:-180}"`.
4. Ordinary wake: if the command prints `signal:`, `stale:`, `check:`, or `heartbeat`, drain queued wakes, handle that wake, then start the next checkpoint.
5. If the command prints `checkpoint:` or exits 124 with no wake, drain queued wakes anyway, process any queued user message now visible to Codex, then start the next checkpoint.
6. Session lock: if the command prints `watcher: read-only - another firstmate session holds this home's session lock`, it declined and exited 0.
   That is correct, not a failure: stay read-only, tell the captain another session controls this fleet, and do not start another checkpoint.
   A `watcher: no live session holds this home's session lock` notice means the checkpoint ran anyway; run `bin/fm-session-start.sh` to claim the lock.
7. Never use shell `&` or Codex background tasks for firstmate watcher supervision.
8. Do not run `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh` as Codex's normal supervision command.
   If it is ever shelled anyway, a backgrounded, piped, or bundled anti-pattern is denied automatically by the PreToolUse seatbelt (`bin/fm-arm-pretool-check.sh`) registered in `.codex/hooks.json`.
9. Failure or missing cycle only: drain queued wakes, inspect the failure, then start a fresh foreground checkpoint.

Codex cannot reason while a foreground tool call is running.
The bounded checkpoint returns control regularly so user messages and queued wakes can be handled without relying on background-task wake semantics.
